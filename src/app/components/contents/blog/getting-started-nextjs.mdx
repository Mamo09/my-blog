# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. Combined with TypeScript, it provides an excellent developer experience and type safety.

## Why Choose Next.js?

- Server-side rendering out of the box
- Automatic code splitting
- Simple page-based routing
- Built-in API routes
- TypeScript support

## Key Features

### Pages Directory
Next.js uses a file-system based router. Files in the `pages` directory automatically become routes.

### API Routes
Create API endpoints by adding files to `pages/api`.

### TypeScript Integration
Full TypeScript support with built-in types and automatic configuration.
